They are of instrumental importance for understanding the emergence of the Cosmic Web. Their relatively simple shape and structure makes them into useful tools for extracting the value of a variety cosmic parameters, possibly including even that of the influence of dark energy. Perhaps most promising and challenging is the issue of the galaxies found within their realm. Not only does the pristine environment of voids provide a promising testing ground for assessing the role of environment on the formation and evolution of galaxies, the dearth of dwarf galaxies may even represent a serious challenge to the standard view of cosmic structure formation.},

Our technique is intended to yield results which can be modeled sufficiently accurately to create a new probe of precision cosmology. We then develop an analytical model of the ellipticity of voids found by our method based on Zel'dovich approximation. We measure in N-body simulation that this model is precise at the 0.1\% level for the mean ellipticity of voids of size greater than {\textasciitilde}4 Mpc/h. We estimate that at this scale, we are able to predict the ellipticity with an accuracy of 0.02. Finally, we compare the distribution of void shapes in N-body simulation for two different equations of state w of the dark energy. We conclude that our method is far more accurate than Eulerian methods and is therefore promising as a precision probe of dark energy phenomenology.},

	abstract = {Voids in the large scale distribution of galaxies were first recognized and discussed as an astrophysical phenomenon in two papers published in 1978. We published the first (Gregory and Thompson 1978) and Joeveer, Einasto and Tago (1978) published the second. The discovery of voids altered the accepted view of the large scale structure of the universe. In the old picture, the universe was filled with field galaxies, and occasional density enhancements could be found at the locations of rich galaxy clusters or superclusters. In the new picture, voids are interspersed between complex filamentary supercluster structure that forms the so-called cosmic web. The key observational prerequisite for the discovery of voids was a wide-angle redshift survey displayed as a cone diagram that extended far enough in distance to show a fair sample of the universe (i.e., well beyond the Local Supercluster). The initial impact of the 1978 discovery of voids was stunted for several years by theoretical cosmologists in the West who were not quite sure how filaments and voids could emerge from what otherwise appeared to be a homogeneous universe. After it became clear several years later that theoretical models of structure formation could explain the phenomenon, the new void and supercluster paradigm became widely accepted.},

The distribution of void sizes in the different simulations shows good agreement. Voids very clearly correspond to minima in the smoothed initial density field. We find a universal void mass profile of the form \${\textbackslash}rho({\textless}r)/{\textbackslash}rho(r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}) {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}exp[(r/r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}){\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha]\$ where \$r\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}\$ is the effective radius of a void and \${\textbackslash}alpha{\textbackslash}sim 2\$. The mass function of haloes in voids is steeper than that of haloes that populate denser regions. The abundances of void haloes seem to evolve somewhat more strongly between redshifts \${\textbackslash}sim 1\$ and 0 than the global abundances of haloes. (abridged)},

Using the VoidFinder algorithm as described by Hoyle 2002, we identify 1054 statistically significant voids in the northern galactic hemisphere with radii {\textgreater} 10 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc. The filling factor of voids in the sample volume is 62\%. The largest void is just over 30 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc in effective radius. The median effective radius is 17 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc. The voids are found to be significantly underdense, with density contrast {\textbackslash}delta {\textless} -0.85 at the edges of the voids. The radial density profiles of these voids are similar to predictions of dynamically distinct underdensities in gravitational theory. We find 8,046 galaxies brighter than M\_r = -20.09 within the voids, accounting for 7\% of the galaxies. We compare the results of VoidFinder on SDSS DR7 to mock catalogs generated from a SPH halo model simulation as well as other {\textbackslash}Lambda -CDM simulations and find similar void fractions and void sizes in the data and simulations.

We have studied the closest example, the Northern Local Void, situated between the Local, Coma, and the Hercules superclusters. We find that this supervoid is not empty, but it contains small galaxy systems and poor clusters of galaxies. We study the cosmography of this void by analyzing the distribution of poor clusters of galaxies, elliptical and other galaxies in two projections. We present a catalogue of voids, defined by galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity, and analyze mean diameters of voids in different environments. The sizes of voids and the properties of void walls are related. Voids defined by poor clusters of galaxies and by bright elliptical galaxies have a mean diameter of up to 40 h-1 Mpc. Faint late-type galaxies divide these voids into smaller voids. The faintest galaxies we can study are outlining voids with mean diameters of about 8 h-1 Mpc. Voids located in a high-density environment are smaller than voids in low-density regions. This analysis shows that voids form a hierarchical system.},

However, void galaxies in the observation sample seem to have generally larger mean–distance than simulated ones at any given void size. In addition, observed void galaxies tend to reside closer to the void center than those in the simulation. This discrepancy is also shown in the density proﬁle of voids.

A pair consists of an A and B simulation with initial conditions related by the inversion δA(x ,tinitial)=-δB(x ,tinitial) (underdensities substituted for overdensities and vice versa). We argue that the technique is valuable for improving our understanding of cosmic structure formation. The A and B fields are by definition equally likely draws from Λ CDM initial conditions, and in the linear regime evolve identically up to the overall sign. As nonlinear evolution takes hold, a region that collapses to form a halo in simulation A will tend to expand to create a void in simulation B. Applications include (i) contrasting the growth of A-halos and B-voids to test excursion-set theories of structure formation, (ii) cross-correlating the density field of the A and B universes as a novel test for perturbation theory, and (iii) canceling error terms by averaging power spectra between the two boxes. Generalizations of the method to more elaborate field transformations are suggested.},

We define voids as spherical regions of ρv = 0.2ρm around density minima in order to relate our results to the predicted abundances using the excursion set formalism. Using a linear underdensity of δv = −2.7, from a spherical evolution model, we find that a volume-conserving model, which does not conserve number density in the mapping from the linear to non-linear regime, matches the measured abundance to within 16 per cent for a range of void radii 1 \&lt; r(h−1 Mpc) \&lt; 15. This model fixes the volume fraction of the universe which is in voids and assumes that voids of a similar size merge as they expand by a factor of 1.7 to achieve a non-linear density of ρv = 0.2ρm today. We find that the model of Sheth and van de Weygaert for the number density of voids greatly overpredicts the abundances over the same range of scales. We find that the volume-conserving model works well at matching the number density of voids measured from the simulations at higher redshifts, z = 0.5 and 1, as well as correctly predicting the abundances to within 25 per cent in a simulation of a matter dominated Ωm = 1 universe. We examine the abundance of voids in the halo distribution and find fewer small, r \&lt; 10 h−1 Mpc, voids and many more large, r \&gt; 10 h−1 Mpc, voids compared to the dark matter. These results indicate that voids identified in the halo or galaxy distribution are related to the underlying void distribution in the dark matter in a complicated way which merits further study if voids are to be used as a precision probe of cosmology.},

	abstract = {We extend earlier work on the problem of estimating the void-volume function – the abundance and evolution of large voids which grow gravitationally in an expanding universe – in two ways. The first removes an ambiguity about how the void-in-cloud process, which erases small voids, should be incorporated into the excursion set approach. The main technical change here is to think of voids within a fully Eulerian, rather than purely Lagrangian, framework. The second accounts for correlations between different spatial scales in the initial conditions. We provide numerical and analytical arguments showing how and why both changes modify the predicted abundances substantially. In particular, we show that the predicted importance of the void-in-cloud process depends strongly on whether or not one accounts for correlations between scales. With our new formulation, the void-in-cloud process dramatically reduces the predicted abundances of voids if such correlations are ignored, but only matters for the smallest voids in the more realistic case in which the spatial correlations are included.},

We compute the void–galaxy cross-correlation function in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) in terms of distances taken along the line of sight and projected into the sky. We analyse the distortions on the cross-correlation isodensity levels and find anisotropic isocontours consistent with expansion for large voids with smoothly rising density profiles and collapse for small voids with overdense shells surrounding them. Based on the linear approach of gravitational collapse theory we developed a parametric model of the void–galaxy redshift space cross-correlation function. We show that this model can be used to successfully recover the underlying velocity and density profiles of voids from redshift space samples. By applying this technique to real data, we confirm the twofold nature of void dynamics: large voids typically are in an expansion phase whereas small voids tend to be surrounded by overdense and collapsing regions. These results are obtained from the SDSS spectroscopic galaxy catalogue and also from semi-analytic mock galaxy catalogues, thus supporting the viability of the standard Λcold dark matter model to reproduce large-scale structure and dynamics.},

Are the voids filled by dwarf galaxies? Do cosmological models predict too many small dark matter haloes inside the voids? Can the problems of cosmological models on small scales be addressed by studying the abundance of dwarf galaxies inside voids? We find that voids in the distribution of 1012 h{\textasciitilde}l Mq haloes (expected galactic magnitudes {\textasciitilde}M*) are almost the same as the voids in 1011 h{\textasciitilde}l Mq haloes. Yet, much smaller haloes with masses 109 h{\textasciitilde}l Mq and circular velocities Ucirc {\textasciitilde} 20 km s-1 readily fill the voids: there should be almost 1000 of these haloes in a 20 h{\textasciitilde}l Mpc diameter void. A typical void of diameter 20 h{\textasciitilde}l Mpc contains about 50 haloes with Ecirc {\textgreater} 50 km s-1. The haloes are arranged in a pattern, which looks like a miniature universe: it has the same structural elements as the large-scale structure of the galactic distribution of the Universe. There are filaments and voids; larger haloes are at the intersections of filaments. The only difference is that all masses are four orders of magnitude smaller. There is severe (anti)bias in the distribution of haloes, which depends on halo mass and on the distance from the centre of the void. Large haloes are more antibiased and have a tendency to form close to void boundaries. The mass function of haloes in voids is different from the ‘normal’ mass function. It is much steeper for high masses, resulting in very few M3 3-type galaxies (i;circ 100 km s-1). We present an analytical approximation for the mass function of haloes in voids.},

We find that the properties of voids selected from GALFORM galaxies are compatible with those of voids identified from a population of haloes with mass M {\textgreater} 1011.5h-1Msolar, similar to the median halo mass, Mmed= 1011.3h-1Msolar. We also find that the number density of galaxy- and halo-defined voids can be up to two orders of magnitude higher than mass-defined voids for large void radii, however, we observe that this difference is reduced to about half an order of magnitude when the positions are considered in redshift space. As expected, there are outflow velocities that show their maximum at larger void-centric distances for larger voids. We find a linear relation for the maximum outflow velocity, vmax=v0rvoid. The void-centric distance where this maximum occurs follows a suitable power-law fit of the form log(dvmax)=(rvoid/A)B. At sufficiently large distances, we find mild infall motions on to the subdense regions. The galaxy velocity field around galaxy-defined voids is consistent with the results of haloes with masses above the median, showing milder outflows than the mass around mass-defined voids. We find that a similar analysis in redshift space would make both outflows and infalls appear with a lower amplitude. We also find that the velocity dispersion of galaxies and haloes is larger in the direction parallel to the void walls by {\textasciitilde}=10-20 per cent. Given that voids are by definition subdense regions, the cross-correlation function between galaxy-defined voids and galaxies is close to ξ=-1 out to separations comparable to the void size, and at larger separations the correlation function level increases, approaching the values of the auto-correlation function of galaxies. The cross-correlation amplitude of mass-defined voids versus mass has a more gentle behaviour remaining negative at larger distances. The cross- to auto-correlation function ratio as a function of the distance normalized to the void radius shows a small scatter around a relation that depends only on the object used to define the voids (galaxies or haloes for instance). The distortion pattern observed in ξ(σ, π) is that of an elongation along the line of sight that extends out to large separations. Positive ξ contours evidence finger-of-god motions at the void walls. Elongations along the line of sight are roughly comparable between galaxy-, halo- and mass-defined voids.},

For the scales of void sizes captured in our simulation, we find that the void formation rate peaks at scale factor 0.3, which coincides with a growth in the void hierarchy and the emergence of dark energy. Voids of all sizes appear at all scale factors, though the median initial void size decreases with time. When voids become detectable they have nearly their present-day volumes. Almost all voids have relatively stable growth rates and suffer only infrequent minor mergers. Dissolution of a void via merging is very rare. Instead, most voids maintain their distinct identity as annexed subvoids of a larger parent. The smallest voids are collapsing at the present epoch, but void destruction ceases after scale factor 0.3. In addition, voids centres tend to move very little, less than 10−2 of their effective radii per ln a, over their lifetimes. Overall, most voids exhibit little radical dynamical evolution; their quiet lives make them pristine probes of cosmological initial conditions and the imprint of dark energy.},

The method is based on tracking watershed basins (contiguous regions around density minima) of well-developed voids at low redshift, on a regular grid of density field. It enables us to construct a robust and continuous mapping between voids at different redshifts, from initial conditions to the present time. We discuss how the new approach eliminates strong spurious effects of numerical origin when voids' evolution is traced by matching voids between successive snapshots (by analogy to halo merger trees). We apply the new method to a cosmological simulation of a standard Λ-cold-dark-matter cosmological model and study evolution of basic properties of typical voids (with effective radii 6 h-1 Mpc {\textless} Rv {\textless} 20 h-1 Mpc at redshift z = 0) such as volumes, shapes, matter density distributions and relative alignments. The final voids at low redshifts appear to retain a significant part of the configuration acquired in initial conditions. Shapes of voids evolve in a collective way which barely modifies the overall distribution of the axial ratios. The evolution appears to have a weak impact on mutual alignments of voids implying that the present state is in large part set up by the primordial density field. We present evolution of dark matter density profiles computed on isodensity surfaces which comply with the actual shapes of voids. Unlike spherical density profiles, this approach enables us to demonstrate development of theoretically predicted bucket-like shape of the final density profiles indicating a wide flat core and a sharp transition to high-density void walls.},

We used our currently available catalog of distance measurements containing 1797 galaxies within 3000 km s-1: Cosmicflows-1. The WF method is used to recover the full three-dimensional peculiar velocity field from the observed map of radial velocities and to recover the underlying linear density field. The velocity field within a data zone of 3000 km s-1 is decomposed into a local component that is generated within the data zone and a tidal one that is generated by the mass distribution outside that zone. The tidal component is characterized by a coherent flow toward the Norma-Hydra-Centaurus (Great Attractor) region, while the local component is dominated by a flow toward the Virgo Cluster and away from the Local Void. A detailed analysis shows that the local flow is predominantly governed by the Local Void and the Virgo Cluster plays a lesser role. The analysis procedure was tested against a mock catalog. It is demonstrated that the WF accurately recovers the input velocity field of the mock catalog on the scale of the extraction of distances and reasonably recovers the velocity field on significantly larger scales. The Bayesian WF reconstruction is carried out within the ΛCDM WMAP5 framework. The WF reconstruction draws particular attention to the importance of voids in proximity to our neighborhood. The prominent structure of the Local Supercluster is wrapped in a horseshoe collar of under density with the Local Void as a major component.},

	abstract = {We study how the properties of cosmic voids depend on those of the tracer galaxy populations in which they are identiﬁed. We use a suite of halo occupation distribution mocks in a simulation, identify voids in these populations using the ZOBOV void ﬁnder and measure their abundances, sizes, tracer densities and dark matter content. To separate the effects of bias from those of sampling density, we do the same for voids traced by randomly downsampled subsets of the simulation dark matter particles. At the same sampling density, galaxy bias reduces the total number of voids by ∼50 per cent and can dramatically change their size distribution. The matter content of voids in biased and unbiased tracers also differs. Deducing void properties from simulation therefore requires the use of realistic galaxy mocks. We discuss how the void observables can be related to their matter content. In particular we consider the compensation of the total mass deﬁcit in voids and ﬁnd that the distinction between over- and undercompensated voids is not a function of void size alone, as has previously been suggested. However, we ﬁnd a simple linear relationship between the average density of tracers in the void and the total mass compensation on much larger scales. The existence of this linear relationship holds independent of the bias and sampling density of the tracers. This provides a universal tool to classify void environments and will be important for the use of voids in observational cosmology.},

Identifying voids with the vide toolkit, we find no statistically significant differences in the ellipticities, but find that coupling produces a population of significantly larger voids, possibly explaining the recent result of Tavasoli et al. In addition, we use the universal density profile of Hamaus et al. to quantify the relationship between coupling and density profile shape, finding that the coupling produces broader, shallower, undercompensated profiles for large voids by thinning the walls between adjacent medium-scale voids. We find that these differences are potentially measurable with existing void catalogues once effects from survey geometries and peculiar velocities are taken into account.},

Because of the recent increased interest in voids, both in very large galaxy surveys and in detailed simulations of cosmic structure formation, this situation is very unfortunate. We here present the first systematic comparison study of 13 different void finders constructed using particles, haloes, and semi-analytical model galaxies extracted from a subvolume of the Millennium simulation. This study includes many groups that have studied voids over the past decade. We show their results and discuss their differences and agreements. As it turns out, the basic results of the various methods agree very well with each other in that they all locate a major void near the centre of our volume. Voids have very underdense centres, reaching below 10 per cent of the mean cosmic density. In addition, those void finders that allow for void galaxies show that those galaxies follow similar trends. For example, the overdensity of void galaxies brighter than mB=−20 is found to be smaller than about −0.8 by all our void finding algorithms.},

Its purpose is rendering a fully volume-covering reconstruction of a density field from a set of discrete data points sampling this field. Reconstructing density or intensity fields from a set of irregularly sampled data is a recurring key issue in operations on astronomical data sets, both in an observational context as well as in the context of numerical simulations. Our technique is based upon the stochastic geometric concept of the Delaunay tessellation generated by the point set. We shortly describe the method, and illustrate its virtues by means of an application to an N-body simulation of cosmic structure formation. The presented technique is a fully adaptive method: automatically it probes high density regions at maximum possible resolution, while low density regions are recovered as moderately varying regions devoid of the often irritating shot-noise effects. Of equal importance is its capability to sharply and undilutedly recover anisotropic density features like filaments and walls. The prominence of such features at a range of resolution levels within a hierarchical clustering scenario as the example of the standard CDM scenario is shown to be impressively recovered by our scheme.},

In the Hu-Sawicki f(R) modified gravity (MG) models, the halo number density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from GR. In contrast, the same f(R) voids are more empty of dark matter, and their profiles are steeper. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing of voids, for which the combination of a spectroscopic redshift and a lensing photometric redshift survey over the same sky is required. Neglecting the lensing shape noise, the f(R) model parameter amplitudes fR0=10-5 and 10-4 may be distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids by 4 and 8 σ for a volume of 1 (Gpc/h)3. The line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the main systematics that limits the significance of this signal for the near future wide angle and deep lensing surveys. For this reason, it is challenging to distinguish fR0=10-6 from GR. We expect that this can be overcome with larger volume. The halo void abundance being smaller and the steepening of dark matter void profiles in f(R) models are unique features that can be combined to break the degeneracy between fR0 and σ8.},

In order to investigate the distribution of galaxies in and around supervoids, we have studied the closest example, the Northern Local Void. It is defined as the region between the Local, Coma, and the Hercules superclusters, which is well covered by available redshift surveys. We find that this supervoid is not empty, but it contains small galaxy systems and poor clusters of galaxies. We study the cosmography of this void by analyzing the distribution of poor clusters of galaxies, elliptical and other galaxies in two projections. We present a catalogue of voids, defined by galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity, and analyze mean diameters of voids in different environments. This analysis shows that sizes of voids and properties of void walls are related. Voids defined by poor clusters of galaxies and by bright elliptical galaxies have a mean diameter of up to 40h{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}Mpc. Faint late-type galaxies divide these voids into smaller voids. The faintest galaxies we can study are outlining voids with mean diameters of about 8h{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}Mpc. Voids located in a high-density environment are smaller than voids in low-density regions. The dependence of void diameters on the type and luminosity of galaxies, as well as on the large-scale environment shows that voids form a hierarchical system.},

	abstract = {On megaparsec scales the Universe is permeated by an intricate filigree of clusters, filaments, sheets and voids, the cosmic web. For the understanding of its dynamical and hierarchical history it is crucial to identify objectively its complex morphological components. One of the most characteristic aspects is that of the dominant underdense voids, the product of a hierarchical process driven by the collapse of minor voids in addition to the merging of large ones.In this study we present an objective void finder technique which involves a minimum of assumptions about the scale, structure and shape of voids. Our void finding method, the watershed void finder (WVF), is based upon the watershed transform, a well-known technique for the segmentation of images. Importantly, the technique has the potential to trace the existing manifestations of a void hierarchy. The basic watershed transform is augmented by a variety of correction procedures to remove spurious structure resulting from sampling noise.This study contains a detailed description of the WVF. We demonstrate how it is able to trace and identify, relatively parameter free, voids and their surrounding (filamentary and planar) boundaries. We test the technique on a set of kinematic Voronoi models, heuristic spatial models for a cellular distribution of matter. Comparison of the WVF segmentations of low-noise and high-noise Voronoi models with the quantitatively known spatial characteristics of the intrinsic Voronoi tessellation shows that the size and shape of the voids are successfully retrieved. WVF manages to even reproduce the full void size distribution function.},

	abstract = {Using a series of high-resolution N-body simulations of the concordance cosmology we investigate how the formation histories, shapes and angular momenta of dark matter haloes depend on environment. We first present a classification scheme that allows us to distinguish between haloes in clusters, filaments, sheets and voids in the large-scale distribution of matter. This method (which goes beyond a simple measure of the local density) is based on a local-stability criterion for the orbits of test particles and closely relates to the Zel'dovich approximation. Applying this scheme to our simulations we then find that: (i) mass assembly histories and formation redshifts strongly depend on environment for haloes of mass M \&lt; M* (haloes of a given mass tend to be older in clusters and younger in voids) and are independent of it for larger masses (M* here indicates the typical mass scale which is entering the non-linear regime of perturbation growth); (ii) low-mass haloes in clusters are generally less spherical and more prolate than in other regions; (iii) low-mass haloes in clusters have a higher median spin than in filaments and present a more prominent fraction of rapidly spinning objects. We identify recent major mergers as a likely source of this effect. For all these relations, we provide accurate functional fits as a function of halo mass and environment. We also look for correlations between halo-spin directions and the large-scale structures: the strongest effect is seen in sheets where halo spins tend to lie within the plane of symmetry of the mass distribution. Finally, we measure the spatial autocorrelation of spin directions and the cross-correlation between the directions of intrinsic and orbital angular momenta of neighbouring haloes. While the first quantity is always very small, we find that spin–orbit correlations are rather strong especially for low-mass haloes in clusters and high-mass haloes in filaments.},

	abstract = {We study the formation and evolution of voids in the dark matter distribution using various simulations of the popular Λ cold dark matter cosmogony. We identify voids by requiring them to be regions of space with a mean overdensity of −0.8 or less – roughly the equivalent of using a spherical overdensity group finder for haloes. Each of the simulations contains thousands of voids. The distribution of void sizes in the different simulations shows good agreement when differences in particle and grid resolution are accounted for. Voids very clearly correspond to minima in the smoothed initial density field. Apart from a very weak dependence on the mass resolution, the rescaled mass profiles of voids in the different simulations agree remarkably well. We find a universal void mass profile of the form ρ(\&lt;r)/ρ(reff) ∝ exp[(r/reff)α], where reff is the effective radius of a void and α∼ 2. The mass function of haloes in voids is steeper than that of haloes that populate denser regions. In addition, the abundances of void haloes seem to evolve somewhat more strongly between redshifts ∼1 and 0 than the global abundances of haloes.},

Their orientations are strongly correlated with significant alignments spanning scales {\textgreater}30h-1Mpc. We also find an intimate link between the cosmic tidal field and the void orientations. Over a very wide range of scales we find a coherent and strong alignment of the voids with the tidal field computed from the smoothed density distribution. This orientation-tide alignment remains significant on scales exceeding twice the typical void size, which shows that the long-range external field is responsible for the alignment of the voids. This confirms the view that the large-scale tidal force field is the main agent for the large-scale spatial organization of the cosmic web.},

	abstract = {N-body simulations have demonstrated a correlation between the properties of haloes and their environment. In this paper, we assess whether the ellipsoidal collapse model, whose dynamics includes the tidal shear, can produce a similar dependence. First, we explore the statistical correlation that originates from Gaussian initial conditions. We derive analytic expressions for a number of joint statistics of the shear tensor and estimate the sensitivity of the local characteristics of the shear to the global geometry of the large-scale environment. Next, we concentrate on the dynamical aspect of the environmental dependence using a simplified model that takes into account the interaction between a collapsing halo and its environment. We find that the tidal force exerted by the surrounding mass distribution alters the axes collapse and causes haloes embedded in overdense regions to virialize earlier. The environment density is the key parameter in determining the virialization redshift, while the environment asphericity primarily contributes to the increase in the scatter of the critical collapse density. An effective density threshold whose shape depends on the large-scale density provides a good description of this environmental effect. Such an interpretation has the advantage that the excursion set formalism can be applied to quantify the environmental dependence of halo properties. We show that, using this approach, a correlation between formation redshift, large-scale bias and environment density naturally arises. The strength of the effect is comparable, albeit smaller, to that seen in simulations. It is largest for low-mass haloes (M {\textless}{\textless} M*), and decreases as one goes to higher mass objects (M {\textgreater} M*). Furthermore, haloes that formed early are substantially more clustered than those that assembled recently. On the other hand, our analytic model predicts a decrease in median formation redshift with increasing environment density, in disagreement with the trend detected in overdense regions. However, our results appear consistent with the behaviour inferred in relatively underdense regions. We argue that the ellipsoidal collapse model may apply in low-density environments where non-linear effects are negligible.},

	abstract = {We develop a picture of cosmic structure formation that identifies virialized cosmological objects with a point process of "peak patches" in the initial (Lagrangian) space. The strongly nonlinear internal dynamics of the collapsing patch is largely decoupled from the weakly nonlinear dynamics describing peak-patch flow. A modest set of local field measurements on the patch region suffices to approximately determine the fate of the peak. The candidate peak points are identified using a hierarchy of smoothing operations on the density field. Patch size and mass are found by requiring complete collapse of a homogeneous ellipsoid model for internal patch dynamics which includes the important influence of the external tidal field. Exclusion algorithms that prevent peak-patch overlaps trim the candidate list into the final "hierarchical peak" list. The Zeldovich approximation with locally adaptive filtering of the displacement field is used for external dynamics to move the surviving patches to their final state (Eulerian) positions, augmented by a quadratic nonlinear correction where necessary. Thus both statistical and dynamical clustering of the peaks are included. Our technique is the natural generalization of both the Press-Schechter method (to include nonlocal effects) and the BBKS single-filter peaks theory (to allow a mass spectrum and solve the cloud-in-cloud problem). It allows efficient Monte Carlo constructions of three-dimensional catalogs of objects such as groups and clusters of galaxies, and, with more selection criteria, of galaxies in their formation phases.},

	abstract = {We present an analytical model for the non-spherical collapse of overdense regions out of a Gaussian random field of initial cosmological perturbations. The collapsing region is treated as an ellipsoid of constant density, acted upon by the quadrupole tidal shear from the surrounding matter. The dynamics of the ellipsoid is set by the ellipsoid self-gravity and the external quadrupole shear. Both forces are linear in the coordinates and therefore maintain homogeneity of the ellipsoid at all times. The amplitude of the external shear is evolved into the non-linear regime in thin spherical shells that are allowed to move only radially according to the mass interior to them. We describe how the initial conditions can be drawn in the appropriate correlated way from a random field of initial density perturbations. By considering many random realizations of the initial conditions, we calculate the distribution of shapes and angular momenta acquired by objects through the coupling of their quadrupole moment to the tidal shear. The average value of the spin parameter, 0.04, is found to be only weakly dependent on the system mass, the mean cosmological density, or the initial power spectrum of perturbations, in agreement with N-body simulations. For the cold dark matter power spectrum, most objects evolve from a quasi-spherical initial state to a pancake or filament and then to complete virialization. Low-spin objects tend to be more spherical. The evolution history of shapes is primarily induced by the external shear and not by the initial triaxiality of the objects. The statistical distribution of the triaxial shapes of collapsing regions can be used to test cosmological models against galaxy surveys on large scales.},

Numerical calculations of the evolution of such perturbations turn out to be well described by an approximate analytic solution of the equations of motion, and simple relationships are found between the initial shape of a perturbation and its shape and kinematic properties at the time of collapse. Perturbations do not change their shape significantly until they reach a density contrast of order unity. As a result, structures with the kinematic properties of the Local Supercluster should form much more commonly in a low-density universe than in a flat universe. The homogeneity of the local Hubble flow, the motion of the Milky Way with respect to the microwave background, and the flattening of the Local Supercluster can be successfully accounted for by these models, provided that the initial perturbation is sufficiently flattened. Viable models are obtained only if the ratio of the lengths of the two smaller axes of the initial perturbation is at least 3:1 in an Einstein-de Sitter universe or at least 1.8:1 in a universe for which the density parameter (Omega) is of order 0.1, when the protocluster pancakes.},

The three components are clearly separated because they arise on distinct spatial scales and are fortuitously almost orthogonal in their inﬂuences. The nearest, which is distinguished by a velocity discontinuity at \$7 Mpc, arises from the evacuation of the Local Void. We lie in the Local Sheet that bounds the void. Random motions within the Local Sheet are small, and we advocate a reference frame with respect to the Local Sheet in preference to the Local Group. Our Galaxy participates in the bulk motion of the Local Sheet away from the Local Void. The component of our motion on an intermediate scale is attributed to the Virgo Cluster and its surroundings, 17 Mpc away. The third and largest component is an attraction on scales larger than 3000 km sÀ1 and centered near the direction of the Centaurus Cluster. The amplitudes of the three components are 259, 185, and 455 km sÀ1, respectively, adding collectively to 631 km sÀ1 in the reference frame of the Local Sheet. Taking the nearby inﬂuences into account, particularly that of the Local Void, causes the residual attributed to large scales to align with observed concentrations of distant galaxies and reduces somewhat the amplitude of motion attributed to their pull. Concerning the motion of \$260 km sÀ1 away from the Local Void, given the velocities expected from gravitational instability theory in the standard cosmological paradigm, the distance to the center of the Local Void must be at least 23 Mpc from our position.

	abstract = {The large-scale structure of the Universe can be observed only via luminous tracers of the dark matter. However, the clustering statistics of tracers are biased and depend on various properties, such as their host-halo mass and assembly history. On very large scales, this tracer bias results in a constant offset in the clustering amplitude, known as linear bias. Towards smaller nonlinear scales, this is no longer the case and tracer bias becomes a complicated function of scale and time. We focus on tracer bias centred on cosmic voids, i.e. depressions of the density ﬁeld that spatially dominate the Universe. We consider three types of tracers: galaxies, galaxy clusters and active galactic nuclei, extracted from the hydrodynamical simulation Magneticum Pathﬁnder. In contrast to common clustering statistics that focus on auto-correlations of tracers, we ﬁnd that void–tracer cross-correlations are successfully described by a linear bias relation. The tracer-density proﬁle of voids can thus be related to their matter-density proﬁle by a single number. We show that it coincides with the linear tracer bias extracted from the largescale auto-correlation function and expectations from theory, if sufﬁciently large voids are considered. For smaller voids we observe a shift towards higher values. This has important consequences on cosmological parameter inference, as the problem of unknown tracer bias is alleviated up to a constant number. The smallest scales in existing data sets become accessible to simpler models, providing numerous modes of the density ﬁeld that have been disregarded so far, but may help to further reduce statistical errors in constraining cosmology.},

This result is valid for any cosmological model and is independent of the shape of the power spectrum. In the early stages of the dynamics the density contrast of the fluctuation is seen to follow with a good accuracy the form δ = (1 - δ\_L\_/1.5){\textasciicircum}-1.5{\textasciicircum} - 1, where δ\_L\_ is the linearly extrapolated overdensity. I then investigate the validity domain of the rare event approximation in terms of the parameter V = δ\_L\_/σ giving the initial overdensity scaled by the rms fluctuation at the same mass scale, and find that it depends critically on the shape of the power spectrum. When the power-law index n is lower than - 1 the departure from the spherical collapse is expected to be small, at least in the early stages of the dynamics, and even for moderate values of ν ({\textbar}ν{\textbar} {\textgreater}= 2). However, for n {\textgreater}= - 1 and whatever the value of ν, the dynamics seems to be dominated by the small-scale fluctuations, and the subsequent evolution of the peak may not be necessarily correlated to its initial overdensity.

Following Birkhoff’s theorem, void regions dynamically evolve as universes with cosmological parameters that depend on the underdensity of the void. We derive the values of  M ,  Ã, and H0 that describe this evolution. We examine how the growth rate of structure and scale factor in a void differ from the background universe. Together with a prescription for the power spectrum of ﬂuctuations, these equations provide the initial conditions for running specialized void simulations. The increased efﬁciency of such simulations, in comparison to general-purpose simulations, allows an improvement of upward of 20 in the mass resolution. As a sanity check, we run a moderate-resolution simulation (N ¼ 1283 particles) and conﬁrm that the resulting mass function of void halos is consistent with other theoretical and numerical models.},

	abstract = {Observational constraints on the isotropy of the microwave background on angular scales greater than Io seriously limit the possible fluctuations in the gravitational potential in the universe because of the SachsWolfe effect. Consequently, they also provide a limit on the initial density inhomogeneities in the universe. We use these limits to show that the typical voids in the mass distribution in an Q = 1 universe have limiting diameter D {\textless} 80/z-1 Mpc and that, for Gaussian initial fluctuations, there should be at most one void in the whole Hubble volume with a diameter D {\textgreater} 130/i\_1 Mpc. Consequently, the observation of voids in the galaxy distribution larger than the above limit would imply that either (1) gravitational instabilities do not produce the observed structure on large scales, (2) variations in the galaxy distribution can be much more extreme than in the mass distribution (that is, light does not trace mass), or (3) the universe has a density parameter Q 7{\textasciicircum} 1. If the current upper limits on the cosmic microwave background isotropy were reduced by a factor of 4, our upper limit would come into conflict with the currently observed sizes of voids, and one would have to invoke one of the above alternatives.},

It was previously argued that the mere existence of such voids poses a severe problem to all dissipationless clustering theories. Here we show that the voids may, in fact, be a natural outcome of a dissipationless clustering scenario if both adiabatic and isothermal density perturbations exist primordially. When the nonlinear evolution of spherical voids of this type is followed for adiabatic perturbations with an index n{\textgreater} — 1, it is seen that they become surrounded by a shell of positive density contrast. Their structure is insensitive to Q{\textgreater}0 while their dynamics is quite sensitive to it.

The prime objective of this study is the production of optimal resolution 3D maps of the volume-weighted velocity and density ﬁelds throughout the nearby universe, the basis for a detailed study of the structure and dynamics of the cosmic web at each level probed by underlying galaxy sample. Fully volume-covering 3D maps of the density and (volumeweighted) velocity ﬁelds in the cosmic vicinity, out to a distance of 150 h−1 Mpc, are presented. Based on the Voronoi and Delaunay tessellation deﬁned by the spatial galaxy sample, DTFE involves the estimate of density values on the basis of the volume of the related Delaunay tetrahedra and the subsequent use of the Delaunay tessellation as natural multidimensional (linear) interpolation grid for the corresponding density and velocity ﬁelds throughout the sample volume. The linearized model of the spatial galaxy distribution and the corresponding peculiar velocities of the PSCz galaxy sample, produced by Branchini et al., forms the input sample for the DTFE study. The DTFE maps reproduce the high-density supercluster regions in optimal detail, both their internal structure as well as their elongated or ﬂattened shape. The corresponding velocity ﬂows trace the bulk and shear ﬂows marking the region extending from the Pisces–Perseus supercluster, via the Local Superclusters, towards the Hydra–Centaurus and the Shapley concentration. The most outstanding and unique feature of the DTFE maps is the sharply deﬁned radial outﬂow regions in and around underdense voids, marking the dynamical importance of voids in the local Universe. The maximum expansion rate of voids deﬁnes a sharp cut-off in the DTFE velocity divergence probability distribution function. We found that on the basis of this cut-off DTFE manages to consistently reproduce the value of m ≈ 0.35 underlying the linearized velocity data set.},

We also use 1000 mock galaxy catalogs that match the geometry, density, and clustering properties of the BOSS sample in order to characterize the statistical uncertainties of our measurements and take into account systematic errors such as redshift space distortions. For both BOSS data and mock catalogs, we use the ZOBOV algorithm to identify voids, we stack together all voids with effective radii of in the redshift range of 0.43–0.7, and we accurately measure the shape of the stacked voids. Our tests with the mock catalogs show that we measure the stacked void ellipticity with a statistical precision of 2.6\%. The stacked voids in redshift space are slightly squashed along the line of sight, consistent with previous studies. We repeat this measurement of stacked void shape in the BOSS data, assuming several values of within the flat model, and we compare this to the mock catalogs in redshift space to perform the AP test. We obtain a constraint of at the 68\% confidence level from the AP test. We discuss the sources of statistical and systematic noise that affect the constraining power of this method. In particular, we find that the measured ellipticity of stacked voids changes more weakly with cosmology than the standard AP prediction, leading to significantly weaker constraints.

Our method is an Alcock–Paczyn´ski (AP) test based on the average sphericity of voids posited on the local isotropy of the universe. It works by comparing the temporal extent of cosmic voids along the line of sight with their angular, spatial extent. We describe the algorithm that we use to detect and stack voids in redshift shells on the light cone and test it on mock light cones produced from N-body simulations. We establish a robust statistical model for estimating the average stretching of voids in redshift space and quantify the contamination by peculiar velocities. Finally, assuming that the void statistics that we derive from N-body simulations is preserved when considering galaxy surveys, we assess the capability of this approach to constrain dark energy parameters. We report this assessment in terms of the ﬁgure of merit (FoM) of the dark energy task force and in particular of the proposed Euclid mission which is particularly suited for this technique since it is a spectroscopic survey. The FoM due to stacked voids from the Euclid wide survey may double that of all other dark energy probes derived from Euclid data alone (combined with Planck priors). In particular, voids seem to outperform baryon acoustic oscillations by an order of magnitude. This result is consistent with simple estimates based on mode counting. The AP test based on stacked voids may be a signiﬁcant addition to the portfolio of major dark energy probes and its potentialities must be studied in detail.},

We probe a total volume of 485 Mpc3 within the voids, with an angular resolution of 8 kpc at an average distance of 85 Mpc. We reach column density sensitivities of 5 × 1019 cm−2, corresponding to an H i mass limit of 3 × 108 M . We detect H i in 41 galaxies, with total masses ranging from 1.7 × 108 to 5.5 × 109 M .

The sample spans a range of absolute magnitudes (−16.1 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} −20.4) and colors (0.06 {\textless} g − r {\textless} 0.87), and includes disk and irregular galaxies.

H i masses range from 3.5×108 to 3.8×109 M , with one nondetection with an upper limit of 2.1 × 108 M . Our galaxies were selected using a structural and geometric technique to produce a sample that is purely environmentally selected and uniformly represents the void galaxy population. In addition, we use a powerful new backend of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope that allows us to probe a large volume around each targeted galaxy, simultaneously providing an environmentally constrained sample of fore- and background control samples of galaxies while still resolving individual galaxy kinematics and detecting faint companions in H i. This small sample makes up a surprisingly interesting collection of perturbed and interacting galaxies, all with small stellar disks. Four galaxies have signiﬁcantly perturbed H i disks, ﬁve have previously unidentiﬁed companions at distances ranging from 50 to 200 kpc, two are in interacting systems, and one was found to have a polar H i disk. Our initial ﬁndings suggest void galaxies are a gas-rich, dynamic population which present evidence of ongoing gas accretion, major and minor interactions, and ﬁlamentary alignment despite the surrounding underdense environment.},

	abstract = {Observations of the high-redshift Universe with the 21 cm hyperfine line of neutral hydrogen promise to open an entirely new window onto the early phases of cosmic structure formation. Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z{\textasciitilde}50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z{\textasciitilde}200 to z{\textasciitilde}6.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for deriving a dynamical lower bound on \{OMEGA\} from diverging flows in low-density regions, based on the fact that large outflows are not expected in a low-\{OMEGA\} universe. The velocities are assumed to be induced by gravity from small initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made regarding galaxy biasing, the exact statistical nature of the fluctuations or \{LAMBDA\}. The derivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to the mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of \{OMEGA\} is assumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the assumed \{OMEGA\} is too low, thus bounding \{OMEGA\}. Observed radial peculiar velocities of galaxies allow the POTENT procedure to recover the required velocity field, Gaussian smoothed at 1200 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. The density and the associated errors are then inferred for different values of \{OMEGA\}, searching for a void which shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary application to data in a southern void indicates that \{OMEGA\} {\textless}= 0.3 can be ruled out at the 2.4 σ level. A detailed study of possible systematic errors is under way.},

	abstract = {Before using void statistics to compare simulations with redshift surveys, it is best to understand the behavior of the statistics as a function of the density fluctuation power spectrum and in the transformation from real space to redshift space. This is most efficiently accomplished by using two-dimensional numerical simulations of gravitational clustering, with initial power spectra of the form P(k) is proportional to k{\textasciicircum}n{\textasciicircum}. We compare the properties of voids in real space to their properties in redshift space. Both the void probability function (VPF) and the underdense probability function (RE) are enhanced in redshift space. The enhancement is greatest in the limit n = - 2. The VPF and UPF treat voids statistically and assume that two-dimensional voids are circular; we present an algorithm that detects individual voids. Voids found by this algorithm are ellipses whose enclosed density of galaxies falls below a threshold density. When voids are identified using this algorithm, the mean void size and the maximum void size both increase in going from real space to redshift space. The increase is greatest in the limit n = - 2. In redshift space, the principal axes of the largest voids in the n = 2 and n = 0 simulations show a statistically significant tendency (at the 95\% confidence level) to be distributed anisotropically, relative to the line of sight from the origin to the void center.},

The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multiﬁbre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 28 diameter ﬁeld. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ ¼ 19:45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 808 Â 158 around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 758 Â 108 along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 ﬁelds spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 deg2 and has a median depth of z  ¼ 0:11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600–8000 A  at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 A˚ and a median S/N of 13 pixel21. All redshift identiﬁcations are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1–5; Q \$ 3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km s21. The overall redshift completeness for Q \$ 3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

Our simulations - carried out using 128{\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum} particles in a cubical box with side 128 Mpc-indicate that the void spectrum evolves with time and that the mean void size in the standard COBE-normalized cold dark matter (CDM) model with h\_50\_ = 1 scales approximately as D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}(z) = D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}\_0\_/(1 + z){\textasciicircum}1/2{\textasciicircum}, where D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}\_0\_ {\textasciitilde} 10.5 Mpc. Interestingly, we find a strong correlation between the sizes of voids and the value of the primordial gravitational potential at void centers. This observation could in principle, pave the way toward reconstructing the form of the primordial potential from a knowledge of the observed void spectrum. Studying the void spectrum at different cosmological epochs, for spectra with a built in k-space cutoff we find that the number of voids in a representative volume evolves with time. The mean number of voids first increases until a maximum value is reached (indicating that the formation of cellular structure is complete), and then begins to decrease as clumps and filaments merge leading to hierarchical clustering and the subsequent elimination of small voids. The cosmological epoch characterizing the completion of cellular structure occurs when the length scale going nonlinear approaches the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential. A central result of this paper is that voids can be populated by substructure such as mini sheets and filaments, which run through voids. The number of such mini-pancakes that pass through a given void can be measured by the genus characteristic of an individual void which is an indicator of the topology of a given void in initial (Lagrangian) space. Large voids have on an average a larger measure than smaller voids indicating more substructure within larger voids relative to smaller ones. We find that the topology of individual voids is strongly epoch dependent, with void topologies generally simplifying with time. This means that as voids grow older they become progressively more empty and have less substructure within them. We evaluate the genus measure both for individual voids as well as for the entire ensemble of voids predicted by CDM model. As a result we find that the topology of voids when taken together with the void spectrum is a very useful statistical indicator of the evolution of the structure of the universe on large scales.},

Not only do they represent a key constituent of the Cosmic Web, they also are one of the cleanest probes and measures of global cosmological parameters. The shape and evolution of voids are highly sensitive to the nature of dark energy, while their substructure and galaxy population provides a direct key to the nature of dark matter. Also, the pristine environment of void interiors is an important testing ground for our understanding of environmental inﬂuences on galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper, we review the key aspects of the structure and dynamics of voids, with a particular focus on the hierarchical evolution of the void population. We demonstrate how the rich structural pattern of the Cosmic Web is related to the complex evolution and buildup of voids.},

Although void galaxies lie in the most underdense parts of our universe, a signiﬁcant fraction of them are gas rich, spiral galaxies that show signatures of ongoing star formation. Not much is known about their cold gas content or star formation properties. In this study we searched for molecular gas in ﬁve void galaxies using the NRO. The galaxies were selected based on their relatively higher IRAS ﬂuxes or Hα line luminosities. CO(1–0) emission was detected in four galaxies and the derived molecular gas masses lie between (1−8)×109 M . The Hα imaging observations of three galaxies detected in CO emission indicates ongoing star formation and the derived star formation rates vary between from 0.2 – 1.0 M yr−1 , which is similar to that observed in local galaxies. Our study shows that although void galaxies reside in underdense regions, their disks may contain molecular gas and have star formation rates similar to galaxies in denser environments.},

Their properties are probed via optical spectroscopy, ugri surface photometry, and HI 21-cm line measurements, with emphasis on their evolutionary status. We derive directly the hydrogen mass M(HI), the ratio M (HI)/LB and the evolutionary parameter gas-phase O/H. Their luminosities and integrated colours are used to derive stellar mass M∗ and the second evolutionary parameter – gas mass-fraction (fg ). The colours of the outer parts, typically representative of the galaxy oldest stellar population, are used to estimate the upper limits on time since the beginning of the main SF episode. We compare properties of void galaxies with those of the similar late-type galaxies in denser environments. Most of void galaxies show smaller O/H for their luminosity, in average by ∼30\%, indicating slower evolution. Besides, the fraction of ∼10\% of the whole void sample or ∼30\% of the least luminous void LSB dwarfs show the oxygen deﬁciency by a factor of 2–5. The majority of this group appear very gas-rich, with fg ∼(95–99)\%, while their outer parts appear rather blue, indicating the time of onset of the main star-formation episode of less than 1–4 Gyr. Such unevolved LSBD galaxies appear not rare among the smallest void objects, but turned out practically missed to date due to the strong observational selection eﬀects. Our results evidense for unusual evolutionary properties of the sizable fraction of void galaxies, and thus, pose the task of better modelling of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution in voids.},

Current star formation rates are derived from H α and recent star formation rates from near-UV imaging. In addition, infrared 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 μm Wide-ﬁeld Infrared Survey Explorer emission is used as star formation and mass indicator. Infrared and optical colours show that the VGS sample displays a wide range of dust and metallicity properties. We combine these measurements with stellar and H I masses to measure the speciﬁc SFRs (SFR/M∗) and star formation efﬁciencies (SFR/MH I). We compare the star formation properties of our sample with galaxies in the more moderate density regions of the cosmic web, ‘the ﬁeld’. We ﬁnd that speciﬁc SFRs of the VGS galaxies as a function of stellar and H I mass are similar to those of the galaxies in these ﬁeld regions. Their SFR α is slightly elevated than the galaxies in the ﬁeld for a given total H I mass. In the global star formation picture presented by Kennicutt–Schmidt, VGS galaxies fall into the regime of low average star formation and correspondingly low H I surface density. Their mean SFR α/MH I and SFR α/M∗ are of the order of 10−9.9 yr−1. We conclude that while the large-scale underdense environment must play some role in galaxy formation and growth through accretion, we ﬁnd that even with respect to other galaxies in the more mildly underdense regions, the increase in star formation rate is only marginal.},

This provides an ideal opportunity to test theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Imaging of the neutral hydrogen, central in both driving and regulating star formation, directly traces the gas reservoir and can reveal interactions and signs of cold gas accretion. For a new Void Galaxy Survey (VGS), we have carefully selected a sample of 59 galaxies that reside in the deepest underdensities of geometrically identiﬁed voids within the SDSS at distances of ∼100 Mpc, and pursued deep UV, optical, Hα, IR, and HI imaging to study in detail the morphology and kinematics of both the stellar and gaseous components. This sample allows us to not only examine the global statistical properties of void galaxies, but also to explore the details of the dynamical properties. We present an overview of the VGS, and highlight key results on the HI content and individually interesting systems. In general, we ﬁnd that the void galaxies are gas rich, low luminosity, blue disk galaxies, with optical and HI properties that are not unusual for their luminosity and morphology. We see evidence of both ongoing assembly, through the gas dynamics between interacting systems, and signiﬁcant gas accretion, seen in extended gas disks and kinematic misalignments. The VGS establishes a local reference sample to be used in future HI surveys (CHILES, DINGO, LADUMA) that will directly observe the HI evolution of void galaxies over cosmic time.},

We present the results of an alternative test of the matter distribution on these scales using clusters of galaxies, which provide an independent and powerful probe of large-scale structure. We study the density distribution of X-ray clusters from the ROSAT-based REFLEX II catalogue, which covers a contiguous area of 4.24 steradians in the southern hempsphere (34\% of the entire sky). Using the normalised comoving number density of clusters we ﬁnd evidence for an underdensity (30 − 40\%), out to z ∼ 0.04, equivalent to 170 Mpc and with a signiﬁcance of 3.4σ. On scales between 300 Mpc and 1 Gpc the distribution of REFLEX II clusters is consistent with being uniform. We also conﬁrm recent results that the underdensity has a large contribution from the direction of the South Galactic Cap region, but is not signiﬁcant in the direction of the Northern Galactic Cap as viewed from the southern sky. Both the limited size of the detected underdensity and its lack of isotropy, argue against the idea that the Type Ia supernovae data can be explained without the need for dark energy.},

The Cosmicﬂows-2 survey, which has mapped in detail the 3D structure of the Local Universe, reveals that the Local Group resides in a “local sheet” of galaxies that borders a “local void” with a diameter of about 40 Mpc. The void is emptying out at a rate of 16 km s−1 Mpc−1 . In a co-moving frame, the Local Sheet is found to be moving away from the Local Void at ∼ 260 km s−1 . Our model shows how asymmetric collapse due to unbalanced voids on either side of a developing sheet or wall can lead to a systematic movement of the sheet. We conjectured that asymmetries could lead to a large-scale separation of dark matter and baryons, thereby driving a dependence of galaxy properties with environment, but we do not ﬁnd any evidence for this eﬀect.},

However, the observed and simulated voids display remarkably different proﬁle shapes, with the former having much steeper proﬁles than the latter. Sparsity cannot be the main reason for this discrepancy, as we demonstrate that the proﬁle can be recovered with reasonable accuracy even with very sparse samples of tracers. On the other hand, the observed proﬁle shows a signiﬁcant dependence on the galaxy sample used to trace the matter distribution. Samples including low-mass galaxies lead to shallower proﬁles with respect to the samples where only massive galaxies are used, as faint galaxies live closer to the void centre.

An interesting result is that even though, as expected, voids in the dark matter ﬁeld are emptier in f (R) gravity due to the ﬁfth force expelling away from the void centres, this result is reversed when haloes are used to ﬁnd voids. The abundance of voids in this case becomes even lower in f (R) compared to GR for large voids. Still, the diﬀerences are signiﬁcant and this provides a way to tell apart these models. The velocity ﬁeld diﬀerences between f (R) and GR, on the other hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al. (2013), concentrate on the velocity proﬁles around voids. First they show the necessity of four parameters to describe the density proﬁles around voids given two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. This proﬁle is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and the combination of the latter with void density proﬁles allows the construction of model void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions. When these models are tuned to ﬁt the measured correlation functions for voids and galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, small voids are found to be of the void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with being void-in-void. This is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshift space data around voids. These proﬁles can be used to remove systematics on void-galaxy Alcock-Pacinsky tests coming from redshift-space distortions.},

Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2,3,18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the 'web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that 'superclusters' are filamentary cluster-cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together.},

If mass is conserved in the Universe, such a void could explain the 5.3σ Hubble tension. However, the MXXL simulation shows that the KBC void causes 6.04σ tension with standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Combined with the Hubble tension, ΛCDM is ruled out at 7.09σ confidence. Consequently, the density and velocity distribution on Gpc scales suggest a long-range modification to gravity. In this context, we consider a cosmological MOND model supplemented with \$11 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{eV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ sterile neutrinos. We explain why this νHDM model has a nearly standard expansion history, primordial abundances of light elements, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In MOND, structure growth is self-regulated by external fields from surrounding structures. We constrain our model parameters with the KBC void density profile, the local Hubble and deceleration parameters derived jointly from supernovae at redshifts 0.023-0.15, time delays in strong lensing systems, and the Local Group velocity relative to the CMB. Our best-fitting model simultaneously explains these observables at the \$1.14\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ confidence level (2.53σ tension) if the void is embedded in a time-independent external field of \$\{0.055 {\textbackslash}, a\_\{\_0\}\}\$ . Thus, we show for the first time that the KBC void can naturally resolve the Hubble tension in Milgromian dynamics. Given the many successful a priori MOND predictions on galaxy scales that are difficult to reconcile with ΛCDM, Milgromian dynamics supplemented by \$11 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{eV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ sterile neutrinos may provide a more holistic explanation for astronomical observations across all scales.},

It has been claimed that such models cannot fit the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other cosmological data. This is, however, based on the assumption of a scale-free spectrum for the primordial density perturbation. An alternative physically motivated form for the spectrum enables a good fit to both SNe Ia (Constitution/Union2) and CMB (WMAP 7-yr) data, and to the locally measured Hubble parameter.

We present a detailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe, focusing on spherically symmetric `void' models. We allow for the dynamical effects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work which inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile. This is a surprisingly important effect and we reach substantially different conclusions. Models which are open at CMB distances fit the CMB power spectrum without fine tuning; these models also fit the supernovae and local Hubble rate data which favour a high expansion rate. Asymptotically flat models may fit the CMB, but require some extra assumptions. We argue that a full treatment of the radiation in these models is necessary if we are to understand the correct constraints from the CMB, as well as other observations which rely on it, such as spectral distortions of the black body spectrum, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.},

On the basis of realistic mock catalogs we demonstrate that cross correlating galaxies and voids opens up the possibility to calibrate galaxy bias and to define a static ruler thanks to the observable geometric nature of voids. We illustrate how the clustering of voids is related to mass compensation and show that volume-exclusion significantly reduces the degree of stochasticity in their spatial distribution.

	abstract = {Contrary to the common view voids have very complex internal structure and dynamics. Here, we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field inside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity field. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple expanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At scales smaller than the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding subdomains corresponding to subvoids. These subdomains break into even smaller sub-subdomains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of locally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity field responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining the subvoids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale components of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids but they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them cosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations allowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids also act like time machines by `freezing' the development of the medium-scale density fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of structures seen connecting protogalaxies in computer simulations. As a result of this freezing haloes in voids can remain `connected' to this tenuous web until the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and evolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion mechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of matter for extended periods of time.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced discrete persistent structure extractor (DisPerSE, Sousbie, Paper I) is implemented on realistic 3D cosmological simulations and observed redshift catalogues; it is found that DisPerSE traces very well the observed filaments, walls and voids seen both in simulations and in observations. In either setting, filaments are shown to connect on to haloes, outskirt walls, which circumvent voids, as is topologically required by the Morse theory. Indeed this algorithm returns the optimal critical set while operating directly on the particles. DisPerSE, as illustrated here, assumes nothing about the geometry of the survey or its homogeneity, and yields a natural (topologically motivated) self-consistent criterion for selecting the significance level of the identified structures. It is shown that this extraction is possible even for very sparsely sampled point processes, as a function of the persistence ratio (a measure of the significance of topological connections between critical points). Hence, astrophysicists should be in a position to trace precisely the locus of filaments, walls and voids from such samples and assess the confidence of the post-processed sets as a function of this threshold, which can be expressed relative to the expected amplitude of shot noise. In a cosmic framework, this criterion is shown to level with the friends-of-friends structure finder for the identification of peaks, while it also identifies the connected filaments and walls, and quantitatively recovers the full set of topological invariants (number of holes, etc.) directly from the particles, and at no extra cost as a function of the persistence threshold. This criterion is found to be sufficient even if one particle out of two is noise, when the persistence ratio is set to 3σ or more. The algorithm is also implemented on the SDSS catalogue and used to locate interesting configurations of the filamentary structure. In this context, we carried the identification of an 'optically faint' cluster at the intersection of filaments through the recent observation of its X-ray counterpart by Suzaku.},

	abstract = {The cosmic web is one of the most striking features of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened sheets and vast low-density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web - depending on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other. In this paper, we bring 12 of these methods together and apply them to the same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general, these cosmic-web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind, and to study different questions. Therefore, one would not a priori expect agreement between different techniques; however, many of these methods do converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper, we study the agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find a substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example, we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e. Mhalo ∼ 1013.5 h-1 M⊙) as being in filaments. Lastly, so that any future cosmic-web classification scheme can be compared to the 12 methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.},

	abstract = {The cosmic web is the largest scale manifestation of the anisotropic gravitational collapse of matter. It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies clusters and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present-day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100 h-1 Mpc. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines.},

In addition, observed void galaxies tend to reside closer to the void center than those in the simulation. This discrepancy is also shown in the density proﬁle of voids.

The discovery of voids altered the accepted view of the large scale structure of the universe. In the old picture, the universe was filled with field galaxies, and occasional density enhancements could be found at the locations of rich galaxy clusters or superclusters. In the new picture, voids are interspersed between complex filamentary supercluster structure that forms the so-called cosmic web. The key observational prerequisite for the discovery of voids was a wide-angle redshift survey displayed as a cone diagram that extended far enough in distance to show a fair sample of the universe (i.e., well beyond the Local Supercluster). The initial impact of the 1978 discovery of voids was stunted for several years by theoretical cosmologists in the West who were not quite sure how filaments and voids could emerge from what otherwise appeared to be a homogeneous universe. After it became clear several years later that theoretical models of structure formation could explain the phenomenon, the new void and supercluster paradigm became widely accepted.},

We estimate that at this scale, we are able to predict the ellipticity with an accuracy of 0.02.

	abstract = {Using cosmological N-body simulations and the void probability function (VPF), we investigate the statistical properties of voids within a wide range of initially Gaussian models for the origin of large-scale structure. We study the dependence of the VPF on cosmological parameters, on the power spectrum of primordial fluctuations, and on assumptions about galaxy formation. We pay particular attention to the ability of the VPF to diagnose ‘biased galaxy formation’ – the preferential formation of galaxies in regions of high background density and corresponding suppression of galaxy formation in regions of low background density. We find that the VPF is insensitive to the cosmic density parameter Ω0 and the cosmological constant λ0, provided that fluctuations are normalized to a fixed rms amplitude on scales \${\textbackslash}sim 8 {\textbackslash}enspace h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$ Mpc. In the absence of biasing, the VPF is also insensitive to the shape of the initial power spectrum. The VPF does depend on the prescription adopted for biased galaxy formation, in the obvious sense that a scheme that more efficiently suppresses galaxy formation in low-density regions leads to larger voids. Biased models have systematically higher VPFs than unbiased models, but for a given biasing scheme the VPF is relatively insensitive to the value of the bias factor b, the ratio of rms galaxy fluctuations to rms mass fluctuations. Thus, while the VPF can distinguish unbiased models from some biased models, it is probably not a useful way to constrain the bias factor; uncertainties in the appropriate choice of biasing prescription overwhelm the mild dependence on b.We compare the predictions of our models to the most extensive VPF observations published to date. These data do not require strong biasing; Gaussian models in which galaxies trace mass can reproduce the VPF data to within errors expected from the current finite volume fluctuations. Models with the moderate biasing predicted by cosmological simulations that incorporate gas dynamics yield a slightly better match to the data. Models in which galaxy formation is strongly suppressed in low-density regions produce an excess of large, empty voids.},

In particular, rare ({\textasciitilde}3 a) massive galaxies in voids will have normal bulges, but unevolved, extended disks; we propose that the low surface brightness objects Malin I and Malin II are prototypes of this class of object. Our model predicts that searches for more examples of “ crouching giants ” should be fruitful, but that such galaxies do not provide a substantial fraction of mass in the universe. The identification of dwarf galaxies is relatively unaffected by their environment.},

	abstract = {Galaxy counts and recent measurements of the luminosity density in the near-infrared have indicated the possibility that the local universe may be under-dense on scales of several hundred megaparsecs. The presence of a large-scale under-density in the local universe could introduce significant biases into the interpretation of cosmological observables, and, in particular, into the inferred effects of dark energy on the expansion rate. Here we measure the K-band luminosity density as a function of redshift to test for such a local under-density. For our primary sample in this study, we select galaxies from the UKIDSS Large Area Survey and use spectroscopy from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, the Galaxy And Mass Assembly Survey (GAMA), and other redshift surveys to generate a K-selected catalog of ∼35, 000 galaxies that is ∼95\% spectroscopically complete at KAB {\textless} 16.3 (KAB {\textless} 17 in the GAMA fields). To complement this sample at low redshifts, we also analyze a K-selected sample from the 2M++ catalog, which combines Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry with redshifts from the 2MASS redshift survey, the Six-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey, and the SDSS. The combination of these samples allows for a detailed measurement of the K-band luminosity density as a function of distance over the redshift range 0.01 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.2 (radial distances D ∼ 50–800 Mpc). We find that the overall shape of the z = 0 rest-frame K-band luminosity function (M*–5log (h70) = −22.15 ± 0.04 and α = −1.02 ± 0.03) appears to be relatively constant as a function of environment and distance from us. We find a local (z {\textless} 0.07, D {\textless} 300 Mpc) luminosity density that is in good agreement with previous studies. Beyond z ∼ 0.07, we detect a rising luminosity density that reaches a value of roughly ∼1.5 times higher than that measured locally at z {\textgreater} 0.1. This suggests that the stellar mass density as a function of distance follows a similar trend. Assuming that luminous matter traces the underlying dark matter distribution, this implies that the local mass density of the universe may be lower than the global mass density on a scale and amplitude sufficient to introduce significant biases into the determination of basic cosmological observables. An under-density of roughly this scale and amplitude could resolve the apparent tension between direct measurements of the Hubble constant and those inferred by Planck.},

	abstract = {The standard Λ Cold Dark Matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model provides a good description of a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological data. However, there are a few big open questions that make the standard model look like an approximation to a more realistic scenario yet to be found. In this paper, we list a few important goals that need to be addressed in the next decade, taking into account the current discordances between the different cosmological probes, such as the disagreement in the value of the Hubble constant H0, the σ8–S8 tension, and other less statistically significant anomalies. While these discordances can still be in part the result of systematic errors, their persistence after several years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard cosmological scenario and the necessity for new physics or generalisations beyond the standard model. In this paper, we focus on the 5.0σ tension between the Planck CMB estimate of the Hubble constant H0 and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing the H0 evaluations made from different teams using different methods and geometric calibrations, we list a few interesting new physics models that could alleviate this tension and discuss how the next decade's experiments will be crucial. Moreover, we focus on the tension of the Planck CMB data with weak lensing measurements and redshift surveys, about the value of the matter energy density Ωm, and the amplitude or rate of the growth of structure (σ8,fσ8). We list a few interesting models proposed for alleviating this tension, and we discuss the importance of trying to fit a full array of data with a single model and not just one parameter at a time. Additionally, we present a wide range of other less discussed anomalies at a statistical significance level lower than the H0–S8 tensions which may also constitute hints towards new physics, and we discuss possible generic theoretical approaches that can collectively explain the non-standard nature of these signals. Finally, we give an overview of upgraded experiments and next-generation space missions and facilities on Earth that will be of crucial importance to address all these open questions.},

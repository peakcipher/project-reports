	abstract = {We extract void catalogs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 (SDSS DR16) survey and also from the Millennium simulation. We focus our comparison on distribution of galaxies brighter than Mr {\textless} −18 inside voids and study the mean separation of void galaxies, distance from the void center, and the radial density proﬁle. We ﬁnd that mean separation of void galaxies depends on void size, as bigger voids have lower mean separation in both samples. However, void galaxies in the observation sample seem to have generally larger mean–distance than simulated ones at any given void size. In addition, observed void galaxies tend to reside closer to the void center than those in the simulation. This discrepancy is also shown in the density proﬁle of voids. Regardless of the void size, the central densities of real void proﬁles are higher than the ones in the predicted simulated catalog.},

We study the cosmography of this void by analyzing the distribution of poor clusters of galaxies, elliptical and other galaxies in two projections. We present a catalogue of voids, defined by galaxies of different morphological type and luminosity, and analyze mean diameters of voids in different environments. The sizes of voids and the properties of void walls are related. Voids defined by poor clusters of galaxies and by bright elliptical galaxies have a mean diameter of up to 40 h-1 Mpc. Faint late-type galaxies divide these voids into smaller voids. The faintest galaxies we can study are outlining voids with mean diameters of about 8 h-1 Mpc. Voids located in a high-density environment are smaller than voids in low-density regions. This analysis shows that voids form a hierarchical system.},

The filling factor of voids in the sample volume is 62\%. The largest void is just over 30 h{\textasciicircum}\{-1\} Mpc in effective radius.

The radial density profiles of these voids are similar to predictions of dynamically distinct underdensities in gravitational theory. We find 8,046 galaxies brighter than M\_r = -20.09 within the voids, accounting for 7\% of the galaxies. We compare the results of VoidFinder on SDSS DR7 to mock catalogs generated from a SPH halo model simulation as well as other {\textbackslash}Lambda -CDM simulations and find similar void fractions and void sizes in the data and simulations.

The discovery of voids altered the accepted view of the large scale structure of the universe. In the old picture, the universe was filled with field galaxies, and occasional density enhancements could be found at the locations of rich galaxy clusters or superclusters. In the new picture, voids are interspersed between complex filamentary supercluster structure that forms the so-called cosmic web. The key observational prerequisite for the discovery of voids was a wide-angle redshift survey displayed as a cone diagram that extended far enough in distance to show a fair sample of the universe (i.e., well beyond the Local Supercluster). The initial impact of the 1978 discovery of voids was stunted for several years by theoretical cosmologists in the West who were not quite sure how filaments and voids could emerge from what otherwise appeared to be a homogeneous universe. After it became clear several years later that theoretical models of structure formation could explain the phenomenon, the new void and supercluster paradigm became widely accepted.},

We measure in N-body simulation that this model is precise at the 0.1\% level for the mean ellipticity of voids of size greater than {\textasciitilde}4 Mpc/h. We estimate that at this scale, we are able to predict the ellipticity with an accuracy of 0.02. Finally, we compare the distribution of void shapes in N-body simulation for two different equations of state w of the dark energy. We conclude that our method is far more accurate than Eulerian methods and is therefore promising as a precision probe of dark energy phenomenology.},

It represents the transitional stage between linear and non-linear structures and contains easily accessible information about the early phases of structure formation processes. Here we investigate the characteristics and the time evolution of morphological components. Our analysis involves the application of the NEXUS Multiscale Morphology Filter technique, predominantly its NEXUS+ version, to high resolution and large volume cosmological simulations. We quantify the cosmic web components in terms of their mass and volume content, their density distribution and halo populations. We employ new analysis techniques to determine the spatial extent of filaments and sheets, like their total length and local width. This analysis identifies clusters and filaments as the most prominent components of the web. In contrast, while voids and sheets take most of the volume, they correspond to underdense environments and are devoid of group-sized and more massive haloes. At early times the cosmos is dominated by tenuous filaments and sheets, which, during subsequent evolution, merge together, such that the present-day web is dominated by fewer, but much more massive, structures. The analysis of the mass transport between environments clearly shows how matter flows from voids into walls, and then via filaments into cluster regions, which form the nodes of the cosmic web. We also study the properties of individual filamentary branches, to find long, almost straight, filaments extending to distances larger than 100 h-1 Mpc. These constitute the bridges between massive clusters, which seem to form along approximatively straight lines.},

	abstract = {The cosmic web is one of the most striking features of the distribution of galaxies and dark matter on the largest scales in the Universe. It is composed of dense regions packed full of galaxies, long filamentary bridges, flattened sheets and vast low-density voids. The study of the cosmic web has focused primarily on the identification of such features, and on understanding the environmental effects on galaxy formation and halo assembly. As such, a variety of different methods have been devised to classify the cosmic web - depending on the data at hand, be it numerical simulations, large sky surveys or other. In this paper, we bring 12 of these methods together and apply them to the same data set in order to understand how they compare. In general, these cosmic-web classifiers have been designed with different cosmological goals in mind, and to study different questions. Therefore, one would not a priori expect agreement between different techniques; however, many of these methods do converge on the identification of specific features. In this paper, we study the agreements and disparities of the different methods. For example, each method finds that knots inhabit higher density regions than filaments, etc. and that voids have the lowest densities. For a given web environment, we find a substantial overlap in the density range assigned by each web classification scheme. We also compare classifications on a halo-by-halo basis; for example, we find that 9 of 12 methods classify around a third of group-mass haloes (i.e. Mhalo ∼ 1013.5 h-1 M⊙) as being in filaments. Lastly, so that any future cosmic-web classification scheme can be compared to the 12 methods used here, we have made all the data used in this paper public.},

	abstract = {The recently introduced discrete persistent structure extractor (DisPerSE, Sousbie, Paper I) is implemented on realistic 3D cosmological simulations and observed redshift catalogues; it is found that DisPerSE traces very well the observed filaments, walls and voids seen both in simulations and in observations. In either setting, filaments are shown to connect on to haloes, outskirt walls, which circumvent voids, as is topologically required by the Morse theory. Indeed this algorithm returns the optimal critical set while operating directly on the particles. DisPerSE, as illustrated here, assumes nothing about the geometry of the survey or its homogeneity, and yields a natural (topologically motivated) self-consistent criterion for selecting the significance level of the identified structures. It is shown that this extraction is possible even for very sparsely sampled point processes, as a function of the persistence ratio (a measure of the significance of topological connections between critical points). Hence, astrophysicists should be in a position to trace precisely the locus of filaments, walls and voids from such samples and assess the confidence of the post-processed sets as a function of this threshold, which can be expressed relative to the expected amplitude of shot noise. In a cosmic framework, this criterion is shown to level with the friends-of-friends structure finder for the identification of peaks, while it also identifies the connected filaments and walls, and quantitatively recovers the full set of topological invariants (number of holes, etc.) directly from the particles, and at no extra cost as a function of the persistence threshold. This criterion is found to be sufficient even if one particle out of two is noise, when the persistence ratio is set to 3σ or more. The algorithm is also implemented on the SDSS catalogue and used to locate interesting configurations of the filamentary structure. In this context, we carried the identification of an 'optically faint' cluster at the intersection of filaments through the recent observation of its X-ray counterpart by Suzaku.},

Our focus is on the evolution of the mean void ellipticity and its underlying physical cause. To this end, we analyse the morphological properties of voids in five sets of cosmological N-body simulations, each with a different nature of dark energy. To address the question of whether galaxy redshift surveys yield sufficiently accurate void morphologies, voids in the dark matter distribution are compared to those in the halo population. Voids are identified using the parameter-free Watershed Void Finder. The effect of redshift distortions is investigated as well. The main conclusions of this study are as follows: (i) the statistically significant sensitivity of voids in the dark matter distribution is confirmed; (ii) the level of clustering as measured by σ8(z) is identified as the main cause of differences in the mean void shape {\textless}ɛ{\textgreater}; and (iii) in the halo and/or galaxy distribution, it is practically unfeasible to distinguish at a statistically significant level between the various cosmologies due to the sparsity and spatial bias of the sample.},

	abstract = {Contrary to the common view voids have very complex internal structure and dynamics. Here, we show how the hierarchy of structures in the density field inside voids is reflected by a similar hierarchy of structures in the velocity field. Voids defined by dense filaments and clusters can de described as simple expanding domains with coherent flows everywhere except at their boundaries. At scales smaller than the void radius the velocity field breaks into expanding subdomains corresponding to subvoids. These subdomains break into even smaller sub-subdomains at smaller scales resulting in a nesting hierarchy of locally expanding domains. The ratio between the magnitude of the velocity field responsible for the expansion of the void and the velocity field defining the subvoids is approximately one order of magnitude. The small-scale components of the velocity field play a minor role in the shaping of the voids but they define the local dynamics directly affecting the processes of galaxy formation and evolution. The super-Hubble expansion inside voids makes them cosmic magnifiers by stretching their internal primordial density fluctuations allowing us to probe the small scales in the primordial density field. Voids also act like time machines by `freezing' the development of the medium-scale density fluctuations responsible for the formation of the tenuous web of structures seen connecting protogalaxies in computer simulations. As a result of this freezing haloes in voids can remain `connected' to this tenuous web until the present time. This may have an important effect in the formation and evolution of galaxies in voids by providing an efficient gas accretion mechanism via coherent low-velocity streams that can keep a steady inflow of matter for extended periods of time.},

While traditional analyses focus on the absolute clustering amplitude of high-density regions mapped out by galaxy surveys, we propose a relative measurement that compares those to the underdense regions, cosmic voids. On the basis of realistic mock catalogs we demonstrate that cross correlating galaxies and voids opens up the possibility to calibrate galaxy bias and to define a static ruler thanks to the observable geometric nature of voids. We illustrate how the clustering of voids is related to mass compensation and show that volume-exclusion significantly reduces the degree of stochasticity in their spatial distribution. Extracting the spherically averaged distribution of galaxies inside voids from their cross correlations reveals a remarkable concordance with the mass-density profile of voids.},

A key challenge for such models is to fit the detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a detailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe, focusing on spherically symmetric `void' models. We allow for the dynamical effects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work which inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile. This is a surprisingly important effect and we reach substantially different conclusions. Models which are open at CMB distances fit the CMB power spectrum without fine tuning; these models also fit the supernovae and local Hubble rate data which favour a high expansion rate. Asymptotically flat models may fit the CMB, but require some extra assumptions. We argue that a full treatment of the radiation in these models is necessary if we are to understand the correct constraints from the CMB, as well as other observations which rely on it, such as spectral distortions of the black body spectrum, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.},

However, this may be an artifact of interpreting the data in an (oversimplified) homogeneous model universe. In the simplest inhomogeneous model which fits the SNe Ia Hubble diagram without dark energy, we are located close to the center of a void modeled by a Lemaítre-Tolman-Bondi metric. It has been claimed that such models cannot fit the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and other cosmological data. This is, however, based on the assumption of a scale-free spectrum for the primordial density perturbation. An alternative physically motivated form for the spectrum enables a good fit to both SNe Ia (Constitution/Union2) and CMB (WMAP 7-yr) data, and to the locally measured Hubble parameter. Constraints from baryon acoustic oscillations and primordial nucleosynthesis are also satisfied.},

	abstract = {The KBC void is a local underdensity with the observed relative density contrast δ ≡ 1 - ρ/ρ0 = 0.46 ± 0.06 between 40 and 300 Mpc around the Local Group. If mass is conserved in the Universe, such a void could explain the 5.3σ Hubble tension. However, the MXXL simulation shows that the KBC void causes 6.04σ tension with standard cosmology (ΛCDM). Combined with the Hubble tension, ΛCDM is ruled out at 7.09σ confidence. Consequently, the density and velocity distribution on Gpc scales suggest a long-range modification to gravity. In this context, we consider a cosmological MOND model supplemented with \$11 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{eV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ sterile neutrinos. We explain why this νHDM model has a nearly standard expansion history, primordial abundances of light elements, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. In MOND, structure growth is self-regulated by external fields from surrounding structures. We constrain our model parameters with the KBC void density profile, the local Hubble and deceleration parameters derived jointly from supernovae at redshifts 0.023-0.15, time delays in strong lensing systems, and the Local Group velocity relative to the CMB. Our best-fitting model simultaneously explains these observables at the \$1.14\{\{{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}rm per{\textbackslash} cent\}\}\$ confidence level (2.53σ tension) if the void is embedded in a time-independent external field of \$\{0.055 {\textbackslash}, a\_\{\_0\}\}\$ . Thus, we show for the first time that the KBC void can naturally resolve the Hubble tension in Milgromian dynamics. Given the many successful a priori MOND predictions on galaxy scales that are difficult to reconcile with ΛCDM, Milgromian dynamics supplemented by \$11 {\textbackslash}, {\textbackslash}rm \{eV\}/c{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ sterile neutrinos may provide a more holistic explanation for astronomical observations across all scales.},

Numerical simulations of the growth of initial density fluctuations through a nonlinear regime, motivated by the likely physics of the early Universe, also show a network of filaments and voids2,3,18, but the origin of this picture of filaments as the dominant structure was not well understood. Here we show that the 'web' of filaments that defines the final state in these simulations is present in the initial density fluctuations; the pattern of the web is defined largely by the rare density peaks in the initial fluctuations, with the subsequent nonlinear evolution of the structure bringing the filamentary network into sharper relief. Applying these results to the observed galaxy distribution, we suggest that 'superclusters' are filamentary cluster-cluster bridges, and we predict that the most pronounced filaments will be found between clusters of galaxies that are aligned with each other and close together.},

	abstract = {Cosmic voids are becoming key players in testing the physics of our Universe. Here we concentrate on the abundances and the dynamics of voids as these are among the best candidates to provide information on cosmological parameters. Cai, Padilla \& Li (2014) use the abundance of voids to tell apart Hu \& Sawicki f (R) models from General Relativity. An interesting result is that even though, as expected, voids in the dark matter ﬁeld are emptier in f (R) gravity due to the ﬁfth force expelling away from the void centres, this result is reversed when haloes are used to ﬁnd voids. The abundance of voids in this case becomes even lower in f (R) compared to GR for large voids. Still, the diﬀerences are signiﬁcant and this provides a way to tell apart these models. The velocity ﬁeld diﬀerences between f (R) and GR, on the other hand, are the same for halo voids and for dark matter voids. Paz et al. (2013), concentrate on the velocity proﬁles around voids. First they show the necessity of four parameters to describe the density proﬁles around voids given two distinct void populations, voids-in-voids and voids-in-clouds. This proﬁle is used to predict peculiar velocities around voids, and the combination of the latter with void density proﬁles allows the construction of model void-galaxy cross-correlation functions with redshift space distortions. When these models are tuned to ﬁt the measured correlation functions for voids and galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, small voids are found to be of the void-in-cloud type, whereas larger ones are consistent with being void-in-void. This is a novel result that is obtained directly from redshift space data around voids. These proﬁles can be used to remove systematics on void-galaxy Alcock-Pacinsky tests coming from redshift-space distortions.},

However, the observed and simulated voids display remarkably different proﬁle shapes, with the former having much steeper proﬁles than the latter. Sparsity cannot be the main reason for this discrepancy, as we demonstrate that the proﬁle can be recovered with reasonable accuracy even with very sparse samples of tracers. On the other hand, the observed proﬁle shows a signiﬁcant dependence on the galaxy sample used to trace the matter distribution. Samples including low-mass galaxies lead to shallower proﬁles with respect to the samples where only massive galaxies are used, as faint galaxies live closer to the void centre. We argue that galaxies are biased tracers when used to probe the matter distribution within voids.},

In the Hu-Sawicki f(R) modified gravity (MG) models, the halo number density profiles of voids are not distinguishable from GR. In contrast, the same f(R) voids are more empty of dark matter, and their profiles are steeper. This can in principle be observed by weak gravitational lensing of voids, for which the combination of a spectroscopic redshift and a lensing photometric redshift survey over the same sky is required. Neglecting the lensing shape noise, the f(R) model parameter amplitudes fR0=10-5 and 10-4 may be distinguished from GR using the lensing tangential shear signal around voids by 4 and 8 σ for a volume of 1 (Gpc/h)3. The line-of-sight projection of large-scale structure is the main systematics that limits the significance of this signal for the near future wide angle and deep lensing surveys. For this reason, it is challenging to distinguish fR0=10-6 from GR. We expect that this can be overcome with larger volume. The halo void abundance being smaller and the steepening of dark matter void profiles in f(R) models are unique features that can be combined to break the degeneracy between fR0 and σ8.},

The Cosmicﬂows-2 survey, which has mapped in detail the 3D structure of the Local Universe, reveals that the Local Group resides in a “local sheet” of galaxies that borders a “local void” with a diameter of about 40 Mpc. The void is emptying out at a rate of 16 km s−1 Mpc−1 . In a co-moving frame, the Local Sheet is found to be moving away from the Local Void at ∼ 260 km s−1 . Our model shows how asymmetric collapse due to unbalanced voids on either side of a developing sheet or wall can lead to a systematic movement of the sheet. We conjectured that asymmetries could lead to a large-scale separation of dark matter and baryons, thereby driving a dependence of galaxy properties with environment, but we do not ﬁnd any evidence for this eﬀect.},

We study the density distribution of X-ray clusters from the ROSAT-based REFLEX II catalogue, which covers a contiguous area of 4.24 steradians in the southern hempsphere (34\% of the entire sky). Using the normalised comoving number density of clusters we ﬁnd evidence for an underdensity (30 − 40\%), out to z ∼ 0.04, equivalent to 170 Mpc and with a signiﬁcance of 3.4σ. On scales between 300 Mpc and 1 Gpc the distribution of REFLEX II clusters is consistent with being uniform. We also conﬁrm recent results that the underdensity has a large contribution from the direction of the South Galactic Cap region, but is not signiﬁcant in the direction of the Northern Galactic Cap as viewed from the southern sky. Both the limited size of the detected underdensity and its lack of isotropy, argue against the idea that the Type Ia supernovae data can be explained without the need for dark energy.},

This provides an ideal opportunity to test theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Imaging of the neutral hydrogen, central in both driving and regulating star formation, directly traces the gas reservoir and can reveal interactions and signs of cold gas accretion. For a new Void Galaxy Survey (VGS), we have carefully selected a sample of 59 galaxies that reside in the deepest underdensities of geometrically identiﬁed voids within the SDSS at distances of ∼100 Mpc, and pursued deep UV, optical, Hα, IR, and HI imaging to study in detail the morphology and kinematics of both the stellar and gaseous components. This sample allows us to not only examine the global statistical properties of void galaxies, but also to explore the details of the dynamical properties. We present an overview of the VGS, and highlight key results on the HI content and individually interesting systems. In general, we ﬁnd that the void galaxies are gas rich, low luminosity, blue disk galaxies, with optical and HI properties that are not unusual for their luminosity and morphology. We see evidence of both ongoing assembly, through the gas dynamics between interacting systems, and signiﬁcant gas accretion, seen in extended gas disks and kinematic misalignments. The VGS establishes a local reference sample to be used in future HI surveys (CHILES, DINGO, LADUMA) that will directly observe the HI evolution of void galaxies over cosmic time.},

Infrared and optical colours show that the VGS sample displays a wide range of dust and metallicity properties. We combine these measurements with stellar and H I masses to measure the speciﬁc SFRs (SFR/M∗) and star formation efﬁciencies (SFR/MH I). We compare the star formation properties of our sample with galaxies in the more moderate density regions of the cosmic web, ‘the ﬁeld’. We ﬁnd that speciﬁc SFRs of the VGS galaxies as a function of stellar and H I mass are similar to those of the galaxies in these ﬁeld regions. Their SFR α is slightly elevated than the galaxies in the ﬁeld for a given total H I mass. In the global star formation picture presented by Kennicutt–Schmidt, VGS galaxies fall into the regime of low average star formation and correspondingly low H I surface density. Their mean SFR α/MH I and SFR α/M∗ are of the order of 10−9.9 yr−1. We conclude that while the large-scale underdense environment must play some role in galaxy formation and growth through accretion, we ﬁnd that even with respect to other galaxies in the more mildly underdense regions, the increase in star formation rate is only marginal.},

Their properties are probed via optical spectroscopy, ugri surface photometry, and HI 21-cm line measurements, with emphasis on their evolutionary status. We derive directly the hydrogen mass M(HI), the ratio M (HI)/LB and the evolutionary parameter gas-phase O/H. Their luminosities and integrated colours are used to derive stellar mass M∗ and the second evolutionary parameter – gas mass-fraction (fg ). The colours of the outer parts, typically representative of the galaxy oldest stellar population, are used to estimate the upper limits on time since the beginning of the main SF episode. We compare properties of void galaxies with those of the similar late-type galaxies in denser environments. Most of void galaxies show smaller O/H for their luminosity, in average by ∼30\%, indicating slower evolution. Besides, the fraction of ∼10\% of the whole void sample or ∼30\% of the least luminous void LSB dwarfs show the oxygen deﬁciency by a factor of 2–5. The majority of this group appear very gas-rich, with fg ∼(95–99)\%, while their outer parts appear rather blue, indicating the time of onset of the main star-formation episode of less than 1–4 Gyr. Such unevolved LSBD galaxies appear not rare among the smallest void objects, but turned out practically missed to date due to the strong observational selection eﬀects. Our results evidense for unusual evolutionary properties of the sizable fraction of void galaxies, and thus, pose the task of better modelling of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution in voids.},

CO(1–0) emission was detected in four galaxies and the derived molecular gas masses lie between (1−8)×109 M . The Hα imaging observations of three galaxies detected in CO emission indicates ongoing star formation and the derived star formation rates vary between from 0.2 – 1.0 M yr−1 , which is similar to that observed in local galaxies.

We are conducting a redshifted Hα imaging survey for dwarf galaxies with Mr {\textgreater} −13 in the heart of the well-deﬁned voids FN2 and FN8 using the KPNO 4m Mayall telescope and Mosaic Imager. These data have furnished over 600 strong candidates in a four square degree area. Follow-up spectra ﬁnding none of these candidates to be within the void volumes will constrain the dwarf population there to be 2 to 8\% of the cosmic mean. Conversely, ﬁnding even one Hα dwarf in the void heart will challenge several otherwise successful theories of large-scale structure formation.},

Not only do they represent a key constituent of the Cosmic Web, they also are one of the cleanest probes and measures of global cosmological parameters. The shape and evolution of voids are highly sensitive to the nature of dark energy, while their substructure and galaxy population provides a direct key to the nature of dark matter. Also, the pristine environment of void interiors is an important testing ground for our understanding of environmental inﬂuences on galaxy formation and evolution. In this paper, we review the key aspects of the structure and dynamics of voids, with a particular focus on the hierarchical evolution of the void population. We demonstrate how the rich structural pattern of the Cosmic Web is related to the complex evolution and buildup of voids.},

	abstract = {We apply the adhesion approximation to study the formation and evolution of voids in the universe. Our simulations - carried out using 128{\textasciicircum}3{\textasciicircum} particles in a cubical box with side 128 Mpc-indicate that the void spectrum evolves with time and that the mean void size in the standard COBE-normalized cold dark matter (CDM) model with h\_50\_ = 1 scales approximately as D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}(z) = D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}\_0\_/(1 + z){\textasciicircum}1/2{\textasciicircum}, where D{\textasciicircum}bar{\textasciicircum}\_0\_ {\textasciitilde} 10.5 Mpc. Interestingly, we find a strong correlation between the sizes of voids and the value of the primordial gravitational potential at void centers. This observation could in principle, pave the way toward reconstructing the form of the primordial potential from a knowledge of the observed void spectrum. Studying the void spectrum at different cosmological epochs, for spectra with a built in k-space cutoff we find that the number of voids in a representative volume evolves with time. The mean number of voids first increases until a maximum value is reached (indicating that the formation of cellular structure is complete), and then begins to decrease as clumps and filaments merge leading to hierarchical clustering and the subsequent elimination of small voids. The cosmological epoch characterizing the completion of cellular structure occurs when the length scale going nonlinear approaches the mean distance between peaks of the gravitational potential. A central result of this paper is that voids can be populated by substructure such as mini sheets and filaments, which run through voids. The number of such mini-pancakes that pass through a given void can be measured by the genus characteristic of an individual void which is an indicator of the topology of a given void in initial (Lagrangian) space. Large voids have on an average a larger measure than smaller voids indicating more substructure within larger voids relative to smaller ones. We find that the topology of individual voids is strongly epoch dependent, with void topologies generally simplifying with time. This means that as voids grow older they become progressively more empty and have less substructure within them. We evaluate the genus measure both for individual voids as well as for the entire ensemble of voids predicted by CDM model. As a result we find that the topology of voids when taken together with the void spectrum is a very useful statistical indicator of the evolution of the structure of the universe on large scales.},

The 2dFGRS uses the 2dF multiﬁbre spectrograph on the Anglo-Australian Telescope, which is capable of observing 400 objects simultaneously over a 28 diameter ﬁeld. The source catalogue for the survey is a revised and extended version of the APM galaxy catalogue, and the targets are galaxies with extinction-corrected magnitudes brighter than bJ ¼ 19:45. The main survey regions are two declination strips, one in the southern Galactic hemisphere spanning 808 Â 158 around the SGP, and the other in the northern Galactic hemisphere spanning 758 Â 108 along the celestial equator; in addition, there are 99 ﬁelds spread over the southern Galactic cap. The survey covers 2000 deg2 and has a median depth of z  ¼ 0:11. Adaptive tiling is used to give a highly uniform sampling rate of 93 per cent over the whole survey region. Redshifts are measured from spectra covering 3600–8000 A  at a two-pixel resolution of 9.0 A˚ and a median S/N of 13 pixel21. All redshift identiﬁcations are visually checked and assigned a quality parameter Q in the range 1–5; Q \$ 3 redshifts are 98.4 per cent reliable and have an rms uncertainty of 85 km s21. The overall redshift completeness for Q \$ 3 redshifts is 91.8 per cent, but this varies with magnitude from 99 per cent for the brightest galaxies to 90 per cent for objects at the survey limit.

	abstract = {Before using void statistics to compare simulations with redshift surveys, it is best to understand the behavior of the statistics as a function of the density fluctuation power spectrum and in the transformation from real space to redshift space. This is most efficiently accomplished by using two-dimensional numerical simulations of gravitational clustering, with initial power spectra of the form P(k) is proportional to k{\textasciicircum}n{\textasciicircum}. We compare the properties of voids in real space to their properties in redshift space. Both the void probability function (VPF) and the underdense probability function (RE) are enhanced in redshift space. The enhancement is greatest in the limit n = - 2. The VPF and UPF treat voids statistically and assume that two-dimensional voids are circular; we present an algorithm that detects individual voids. Voids found by this algorithm are ellipses whose enclosed density of galaxies falls below a threshold density. When voids are identified using this algorithm, the mean void size and the maximum void size both increase in going from real space to redshift space. The increase is greatest in the limit n = - 2. In redshift space, the principal axes of the largest voids in the n = 2 and n = 0 simulations show a statistically significant tendency (at the 95\% confidence level) to be distributed anisotropically, relative to the line of sight from the origin to the void center.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for deriving a dynamical lower bound on \{OMEGA\} from diverging flows in low-density regions, based on the fact that large outflows are not expected in a low-\{OMEGA\} universe. The velocities are assumed to be induced by gravity from small initial fluctuations, but no assumptions are made regarding galaxy biasing, the exact statistical nature of the fluctuations or \{LAMBDA\}. The derivatives of a diverging velocity field infer a nonlinear approximation to the mass density, which is an overestimate when the true value of \{OMEGA\} is assumed. This inferred density can become ridiculously negative when the assumed \{OMEGA\} is too low, thus bounding \{OMEGA\}. Observed radial peculiar velocities of galaxies allow the POTENT procedure to recover the required velocity field, Gaussian smoothed at 1200 km s{\textasciicircum}-1{\textasciicircum}. The density and the associated errors are then inferred for different values of \{OMEGA\}, searching for a void which shows negative inferred density with high confidence. A preliminary application to data in a southern void indicates that \{OMEGA\} {\textless}= 0.3 can be ruled out at the 2.4 σ level. A detailed study of possible systematic errors is under way.},

Here we review the physics of the 21 cm transition, focusing on processes relevant at high redshifts, and describe the insights to be gained from such observations. These include measuring the matter power spectrum at z{\textasciitilde}50, observing the formation of the cosmic web and the first luminous sources, and mapping the reionization of the intergalactic medium. The epoch of reionization is of particular interest, because large HII regions will seed substantial fluctuations in the 21 cm background. We also discuss the experimental challenges involved in detecting this signal, with an emphasis on the Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds. These increase rapidly toward low frequencies and are especially severe for the highest redshift applications. Assuming that these difficulties can be overcome, the redshifted 21 cm line will offer unique insight into the high-redshift Universe, complementing other probes but providing the only direct, three-dimensional view of structure formation from z{\textasciitilde}200 to z{\textasciitilde}6.},

	abstract = {Void galaxies, residing within the deepest underdensities of the Cosmic Web, present an ideal population for the study of galaxy formation and evolution in an environment undisturbed by the complex processes modifying galaxies in clusters and groups, as well as provide an observational test for theories of cosmological structure formation. We have completed a pilot survey for the H i imaging aspects of a new Void Galaxy Survey (VGS), imaging 15 void galaxies in H i in local (d {\textless} 100 Mpc) voids. H i masses range from 3.5×108 to 3.8×109 M , with one nondetection with an upper limit of 2.1 × 108 M . Our galaxies were selected using a structural and geometric technique to produce a sample that is purely environmentally selected and uniformly represents the void galaxy population. In addition, we use a powerful new backend of the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope that allows us to probe a large volume around each targeted galaxy, simultaneously providing an environmentally constrained sample of fore- and background control samples of galaxies while still resolving individual galaxy kinematics and detecting faint companions in H i. This small sample makes up a surprisingly interesting collection of perturbed and interacting galaxies, all with small stellar disks. Four galaxies have signiﬁcantly perturbed H i disks, ﬁve have previously unidentiﬁed companions at distances ranging from 50 to 200 kpc, two are in interacting systems, and one was found to have a polar H i disk. Our initial ﬁndings suggest void galaxies are a gas-rich, dynamic population which present evidence of ongoing gas accretion, major and minor interactions, and ﬁlamentary alignment despite the surrounding underdense environment.},

H i imaging of 55 galaxies with the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope reveals morphological and kinematic signatures of ongoing interactions and gas accretion. We probe a total volume of 485 Mpc3 within the voids, with an angular resolution of 8 kpc at an average distance of 85 Mpc. We reach column density sensitivities of 5 × 1019 cm−2, corresponding to an H i mass limit of 3 × 108 M . We detect H i in 41 galaxies, with total masses ranging from 1.7 × 108 to 5.5 × 109 M . The upper limits on the 14 non-detections are not inconsistent with their luminosities, given their expected H i mass-to-light ratios. We ﬁnd that the void galaxies are generally gas-rich, low-luminosity, blue disk galaxies, with optical and H i properties that are not unusual for their luminosity and morphology. The sample spans a range of absolute magnitudes (−16.1 {\textgreater} Mr {\textgreater} −20.4) and colors (0.06 {\textless} g − r {\textless} 0.87), and includes disk and irregular galaxies. We also identify three as early-type galaxies, all of which are not detected in H i. All galaxies have stellar masses less than 3 × 1010 M , and many have kinematic and morphological signs of ongoing gas accretion, suggesting that the void galaxy population is still in the process of assembling. The small-scale clustering in the void, within 600 kpc and 200 km s−1, is similar to that in higher density regions, and we identify 18 H i-rich neighboring galaxies in the voids. Most are within 100 kpc and 100 km s−1 of the targeted galaxy, and we ﬁnd no signiﬁcant population of H i-rich low-luminosity galaxies ﬁlling the voids, contrary to what is predicted by simulations.},

{\large {\bf  ABSTRACT }}

In this work we first discuss the cosmological voids and the galaxies that are present in these crucial components of the Cosmic Web. We work through the arguments that solidify the importance of void galaxies to galaxy formation and the effects of their cosmological neighborhood on galaxy evolution. We discuss the cosmic microwave background radiation and how its anisotropies can be probed in void galaxies, with our interest being on the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. After the theoretical basis we obtain a publicly available void galaxy catalog and create a filter to remove wall galaxies within a void so that we can increase the signal-to-noise ratio in our stacking techniques.
